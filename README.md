## 🪄 Mock APIs easily — no setup stress, just JSON and go

If you’re building or testing APIs, this tool makes mocking painless. You don’t need to write any config files — just use folders and JSON. It’s super fast, efficient, and flexible when you need it to be.

- 🎈 No config needed to get started
- 🥷 Fast to launch, light on memory, out of your way
- 🧩 Moreover, advanced matching and custom scripting supported

It’s rebuilt from the ground up in version 4. Designed to help developers of all levels.

### Getting started

```sh
# install
npm install -D apimock-rs
# and go
npx apimock
```

```sh
# just use folders and JSON
mkdir -p api/v1/
echo '{"hello": "world"}' > api/v1/hello.json
npx apimock

# response
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/hello
# --> {"hello":"world"}
```

```sh
# also, there's room to tweak things later
npx apimock --init
```

## 🛠️ App overhaul announcement

### ⚠️ v4, our new major version, was released. Compatibility Note

v4 is a complete rewrite, breaking compatibility with v3. A direct migration isn't supported; please opt to continue with v3 or start fresh with v4. V4's streamlined file-based and rule-based architecture aims to make new response configurations less burdensome.

## Open-source, with care

This project is lovingly built and maintained by volunteers.  
We hope it helps streamline your API development.  
Please understand that the project has its own direction — while we welcome feedback, it might not fit every edge case 🌱
