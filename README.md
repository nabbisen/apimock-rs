## 🪄 Mock APIs easily — no setup stress, just JSON and go

If you’re building or testing APIs, this tool makes mocking painless. You don’t need to write any config files — just use folders and JSON. It’s super fast, efficient, and flexible when you need it to be.

    🎈 No config needed to get started

    🥷 Fast to launch, light on memory, out of your way

    🧩 Moreover, advanced matching and custom scripting supported

It’s rebuilt from the ground up in version 4. Designed to help developers of all levels.

```sh
# install
npm install -D apimock-rs
# and go
npx apimock
```

```sh
# just use folders and JSON
mkdir -p api/v1/
echo '{"hello": "world"}' > api/v1/hello.json
npx apimock

# response
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v1/hello
# --> {"hello":"world"}
```

```sh
# also, there's room to tweak things later
npx apimock --init
```
