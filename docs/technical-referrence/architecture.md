# Architecture

## Core Components

- based on hyper v1

- **`src/config.rs`**  
  Defines configuration structures for customizable parameters like the server port, root path, logging levels, etc.

- **`src/server.rs`**  
  The HTTP server entry point powered by `hyper`. It handles incoming requests and delegates them to the core logic.

- **`src/core/server/routing.rs`**  
  Contains core logic including request routing, matching rules, response rendering, and script evaluation.

- **`tests/`**  
  Includes test cases run by `cargo test`.
